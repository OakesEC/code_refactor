# Horiseon Code Refactor (link)

## Description
I was tasked with refactoring (updating) the existing codebase of Horiseon's webpage to meet accessibilty standards, so that their site would be optimized by search engines.  This includes the use of more descriptive (semantic) elements, ensure the HTML structure follows a logical pattern for screen readers, alternative attributes (descriptions) for images, heading in sequential order and a concise, descriptive title.



An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the Scout Rule:

> Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve their codebase for long term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
